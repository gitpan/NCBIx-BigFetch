NCBIx-BigFetch version 0.5.6

This module is useful for downloading very large result sets of sequences 
from NCBI given a text query. It uses a YAML configuration 
file to maintain project state in case network or server issues interrupts 
execution, in which case it may be easily restarted after the last batch. 

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL

Copy the fetch-*.pp scripts from the distribution scripts directory to a reasonable
